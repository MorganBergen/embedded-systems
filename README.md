# embedded-systems

The purpose of this repository is to illustrate material pertaining to the course embedded systems.  An embedded system is an intelligent system with special-purpose computation capabilities, (e.g. smart appliance, cars, medical devices, etc.)  The material will cover the hardware and software architecture of embedded systems, as how to program a microprocessor to interact with the physical world through sensors and actuators.

The conceptual material consists of

- introduction to embedded systems, defining embedded systems, differentiating embedded systems from general-purpose computers.

- embedded software echopsystem, introduction to tools and enviroments for developing embedded software (build toolchain, gnu make, ide, git)

- c programming refresher

- RV32 ISA, a brief introduction to RISC-V assembly language

- microprocessor's memory address space

- i/o how to interact with the physical world using sensors and actuators

- interrupt, difference between interrupt and polling, how to use them, and the implications of using them

- concurrency and threads, how to utilize the available parallelism in the hardware and develop concurrent embedded software

- scheduling and real-time scheduling concepts in linux

- cpu and memory architecture, how instructions get executed in the hardware and the micro-architecture of a basic RISC-V, single-cycle processor.
